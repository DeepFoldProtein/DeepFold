# Getting Started

An introductory tutorial for protein conformation prediction.

---

## Configure environment

To install DeepFold framework, run the following command from the command line:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DeepFoldProtein/megafold.git
```

## Get database and parameters

Run scripts.

## Creating a input features

1. Prepare a FASTA file includes amino-acid sequences.
1. Run script `...` to run MSA search and template search.
1. Pickle files will be generated in `...`.

## Predict a protein structure from the input features

Inference procedure for DeepFold framework.

## Relaxing the structure with physical force field

Using physics-based force field to optimize the structure.

# Getting Started

An introductory tutorial for protein conformation prediction.

---

## Get database and parameters

## Configure environment

To install DeepFold, run the following command from the command line:

```bash
git clone 
```

## Creating a input features

- MSA and template search.
- Preprocessing.

## Predict a protein structure from the input features

Inference procedure for MegaFold framework.

## Relaxing the structure with physical force field

Using physics-based force field to optimize the structure.

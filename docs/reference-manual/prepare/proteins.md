# Proteins

---

Proteins are molecular machines, buliding blocks, and arms of a living cell.
Their major and almost sole function is enzymatic catalysis of chemical conversions in and around the cell.
In addition, regulatory proteins control gene expression, and receptor proteins (which sit in the lipid membrane) accept inter-cellular signals that are often transmitted by hormones, which are proteins as well.

A knowledge of the 3D structure of protein is necessary to understand how it functions.
This is the reason why we study protein folding and develop the DeepFold framework.

Proteins are polymers; they are built up by amino acids that are linked into a peptide chain; this was discovered by E. Fischer as early as the beginning of the 20th century.
In the early 1950s, F. Sanger showed that the sequence of amino acid residues (a *residue* is the portion of a free amino acid that remains after polymerization) is unique for each protein.
The chain consists of a chemically regular backbone (main chain) and various side chains.

# Proteins

## Breif introduction

Proteins are most versatile macromolecules in living systems and serve crucial functions in essentially all biological processes.
They function as catalysts, transport and store other molecules such as oxygen, provide mechanical support and immune protection, generate movement, trasnmit nerve impulses, and control growth and differentiation.

*Proteins are linear polymers built of monomer units called amino acids*, which are linked end to end.
The sequence of linked amino acids is called the primary structure.
Remarkably, proteins spontaneously fold up into three-dimensional structures that are determined by the sequence of amino acids in the protein polymer.
Three-diemensional structure formed by hydrogen bonds between amino acids near one another is called secondary structure, whereas tertiary structure is formed by long-range interactions between amino acids.
Protein function depends directly on this three-dimensional structure.
Thus, *proteins are the embodiment of the transition from the one-diemnsional world of sequences to the three-dimensional world of molecules capable of diverse activities*.
Many protein also display quaternary structure, in which the functional protein is composed of several distinct polypeptide chains.

*Proteins contain a wide range of functional groups*.

*Proteins can interact with one another and with other biological macromolecules to from complex assemblies*.

*Some proteins are quite rigid, whereas other display considerable flexibility*.

## Amino acids

Proteins are built from a repertoire of 20 amino acids.

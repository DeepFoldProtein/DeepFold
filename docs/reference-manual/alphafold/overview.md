# Overview

## AlphaFold2

AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (which is the parent company of Google), that performs predictions of protein structure.

AlphaFold has had two major versions. AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) in December 2018.
The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organizers, where no existing template structure were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence.

AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated its placement in the CASP competition in November 2020.
The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group.
It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's global distance test (GDT).

On July 2021, the AlphaFold2 paper ([Jumper2021]) was published in Nature. The source code of the inference part and a searchable database of species proteomes were also published together.

## AlphaFold-Multimer

On October 2021, the update named AlphaFold-Multimer ([Evans2022]) was released. There are some modifications in the network, and protein complexes are included in its training data.

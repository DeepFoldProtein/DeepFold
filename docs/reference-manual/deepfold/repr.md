# Internal Representations

## Constants

Some module attributesÂ are frequently used in the package.
`deepfold.common.residue_constants` is the module where they are declared.

There are 20 different amino acids that are used for building proteins.
You can think of each residue as a token, and every type of amino acid as a different kind of token.
However, sometimes we were unable to identify the exact type of some residues.
In this case, we give those residues an `UNK` (or `X`) token.
There are 21 distinct types of `aatype` for this reason.

In the case of template pair features, it has additional `GAP` (or `-`) token.
This token indicates that there is no structural template for the corresponding residue.
Therefore, there are 22 distinct types for template features.

MSA featuers has one more token named `MASKED_MSA_TOKEN`.
This token is for BERT training proceudre.
Therefore, there are 23 distinct types for MSA features.

## One-hot residue type representation

We follow HHBlits convention.
The one-hot representation can be inversed with following table.

| Code | 1 |  3  | Name             |
|:----:|:-:|:---:|------------------|
|   0  | A | ALA | Alanine          |
|   1  | C | CYS | Cysteine         |
|   2  | D | ASP | Aspartate        |
|   3  | E | GLU | Glutamate        |
|   4  | F | PHE | Phenylalanine    |
|   5  | G | GLY | Glycine          |
|   6  | H | HIS | Histidine        |
